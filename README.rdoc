= syck

* https://github.com/ruby/syck

== DESCRIPTION:

This Gem is a wrapper around {Syck}[https://github.com/indeyets/syck] (a.k.a. Scripters' YAML Cobble-Yourself-a-Parser Kit),
used for parsing YAML.

Syck has been removed from Ruby's stdlib, and this gem is meant to bridge the gap for people that haven't
updated their YAML yet.

If you are starting a new project, you probably should use {Psych}[https://github.com/ruby/psych] instead.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Monkeypatches the crap out of everything

== SYNOPSIS:

  require 'syck'
  Syck.dump %w{ foo bar baz }

== REQUIREMENTS:

* Ruby

== INSTALL:

* gem install syck
